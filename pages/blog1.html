          <h1>Thoughts About Generative Ai</h1>
          <p>
            Automation is great when it makes repetitive tasks easier, but creativity is at the core of who we are as humans. The long-term implications for art are worrisome. Young artists are being discouraged to enter the field, culling
            many potential future masters before they can reach their potential. And because AI art learns from human artists this may eventually lead to stagnation. But I also think that the notion; that people tend to overestimate the
            impact of new technologies in the short term and underestimate it in the long term' will be applicable to AI. It won't have as much impact on jobs etc in the near term, but in 3-5 years it will.
          </p>
          <p>
            In some time we even won't have to talk or write to others anymore, just let ChatGpt handle the entire dialog exchange (on both sides), lol. We don't have to be creative ourselves either at least not if it takes much effort. Why
            do something yourself with effort when AI will do a better job than most people in the future? And if no one can tell if you worked on it yourself or let it generate, is it even worth trying anymore? There are many negative
            implications to this AI revolution that will reveal themselves in time. I for one am very worried. Not only by the disruption to jobs but even more by the unforeseen consequences in the long term. New generations may become lazy
            and dependent on AI and much less resilient.
          </p>
          <p>
            There is virtually no sympathy for artists under non-artists, they love AI image generation. There even seems to be some envy and schadenfreude. The problem of course is that the images used as input for the machine-learning
            algorithms were basically stolen without consent. This is extremely questionable, both morally and legally. But there could be years of disruption from AI generated 'Art' before eventually, legal action could prevent these
            models from using stolen data (All the way up to the supreme court?). Everyone is fine with disruption until they are the ones that get displaced. Finance/investing will be disrupted too just like, (creative) writing, coding,
            and many other fields.
          </p>
          <p>
            Generating AI 'Art' with a text prompt currently feels a bit like going to the casino, and using a slot machine. There is some control over the content of the image but not as much as people think. Even a nonsensical prompt
            frequently leads to a good-looking result. A certain combination of words gives surprising and good results, but changing one word and it can change the whole style, even though you only change the color from red to blue for
            example. It gives the illusion of control, just like a slot machine, but it's mostly random. If you use it enough, you will eventually win something. This AI stuff is the opposite of Art, it's a false dopamine rush as opposed to
            an earned one. It does not challenge you to be truly creative yourself. You learn very little from it but it gives the illusion of doing something productive and artistic yourself. It will create the same addiction behavior that
            social media has done with likes.
          </p>
          <p>
            But eventually, you will have much finer iterative control over AI image generation. Where you can ask the AI to change specific things in an image, either by text prompt or drawing on the image to indicate what should be
            changed.
